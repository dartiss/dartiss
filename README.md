I'm a [WordPress plugin developer](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dartiss/#content-plugins), [contributor](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dartiss/) and [international speaker](https://artiss.blog/speaking/). I'm passionate about inclusive language and statistics. I'm also a regular, but average, gamer, having played poorly since the 1980s.

I'm also a massive geek - ask me about all things Apple, Marvel, Star Wars and Star Trek 🖖🏼

## WordPress Plugins 🔌
Most of my repos are for my WordPress plugins, with many now archived and private. I work on these in my own time and take no donations for their continuation - I write and support them because I like doing so. For this reason, changes may be slow to be made but I will always try and provide support in the WordPress.org forums as quickly as I can. Indeed, that's where all support should be directed. Please use the repo's issues log to look for outstanding issues or to add new features that you'd like to see.

Thank you ♥️
